# rinventory
A fun inventory management CLI written in Rust

This is inspired by [Ledger](https://github.com/ledger/ledger). What could we use a small inventory management system for if it were backed by just plaintext files?
Probably nothing, but why not try and find out!

If anything it could become the basis for something more legitimate.
